# $DEGEN Donors ðŸ’¸ (We didn't win anything ðŸ˜”)

Timmy is a `$DEGEN` Farcaster power user. He has lots of rich crypto friends on Farcaster. 

One day, Timmy's cat, Muffins, came down with tuberculosis. Insurance covered some of it, but it would've been nice to have a little extra liquid. After all, everyone loves Mittens. 

What if Timmy could run a small fundraiser on Farcaster with ***seamless one-click Farcaster wallet integration*** that he could ***start up in mere seconds***? 

**Introducing `$DEGEN` Donors - the simpliest, no-code way to create fundraiser frames on Farcaster**.
